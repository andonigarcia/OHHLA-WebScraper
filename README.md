#OHHLA-WebScraper

This is a simple Web Scraper used to pull lyrics from the [Original Hip-Hop Lyrics Archive](http://ohhla.com/). The lyrics are left out of the github repo because of the extensive size of the archive (and thus the lyrics file). Feel free to clone the repo and run the scraper yourself, but be warned it might take a couple hours to go through all the pages. The OHHLA has a pretty extensive archive.

I intend to use the lyrics with a tweaked version of my Markov Babbler in order to create a Rap Generator. As of 22 Dec. 2014, the regular expressions, used to sanitize the lyrics, need to be improved before this Scraper can be fed to the Markov Model.

Finally, this is my *first ever* program written in Python. Please don't be too harsh judging it, but also **PLEASE** tell me how I butchered Python best practices so I can learn. I literally went from reading the docs to this program. Not a single small test program in between. I also think I did the whole Class/Module thing wrong and in order to execute my file I run 'import OHHLAScraper' which I also think is incorrect. I'm pretty sure any Python expert would cringe at this and re-write it differently. My bad.
